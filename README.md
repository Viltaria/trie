# A demonstration of Trie's
## What
Tries are an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using tries, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length).

## Why
Tries allow you to insert and find strings in O(L) time (where L represent the length of a single word). They also allow you to find words that have a single character different, a prefix in common, a character missing, etc.

### TODO

- [ ] Add Visual Hints
- [ ] Add Possibilities for root level
- [ ] Add total possibilities when you traverse the tree
- [ ] Add linking a JSON file as well as uploading
